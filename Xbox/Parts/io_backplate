The Xbox Series S IO panel is the backside of the console where you can find various ports for connecting accessories and devices.
According to the official website⁴ and other sources, the Xbox Series X IO panel has the following ports:

- **3x USB-A ports**: Two in the back, one in the front. These are for USB accessories primarily, such as headsets, controller recharge
docks and cables, USB storage expansion drives, keyboards and mice, and so on.
- **HDMI-out (2.1)**: This connects your Xbox Series X to your TV. The 2.1 interface adds ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode), which ensures that
your TV automatically switches to its "game mode" setting for lowest latency gaming possible. It also includes VRR (Variable Refresh Rates),
which makes games smoother in motion.

- **Ethernet**: This connects your Xbox Series X to your router via a Cat5 cable; it also has Wi-Fi, of course.
- **Power**: There's a figure-8 power socket as well.
- **SSD expansion**: There's an additional rectangular slot that is an SSD expansion storage card slot, allowing you to expand your Xbox Series X's base memory¹.
- **Kensington lock**: Next to the sticker, there's a small rectangle with a padlock icon. This is a Kensington lock port that allows you to tie hardware down to
a table or something of that nature¹.
